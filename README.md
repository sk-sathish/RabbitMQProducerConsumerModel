# RabbitMQSendReceiveQueue
Working model of RabbitMQ with one Sender and Multiple Receiver

Run one instance of Send.java
and run multiple instance of Receive.java

for running on terminal with maven setup, u can you use the codehaus, which is already added in the pom xml
and run the below command
mvn compile
mvn exec:java

also make sure the java mentioned in the project and JAVA_HOME are same. (i messed it up and lost 1 hour of my time finding it :'( )
